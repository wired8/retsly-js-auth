  [![ScreenShot](http://content.screencast.com/users/slajax/folders/Jing/media/5ed0bf99-d34b-4728-bfd1-cc578ccee711/00000080.png)](http://screencast.com/t/DUy1Se84qdI)

## Installation

  Install with [component.io](http://github.com/component/component):

    $ component install Retsly/retsly-js-auth

## API

The Retsly Auth Component requires a constructed instance of the Retsly
SDK. You should inject into the module as shown below:

```javascript
  var retsly = new Retsly(YOUR_API_KEY, { debug: true });
  var Auth = require('retsly-js-auth')(retsly);
  new Auth({
    selector: '.login', // Target Dom Element
    redirect_uri: 'http://website.com/callback',
    authorized: function(data) {
      console.log('Authorized');
    },
    activated: function(data) {
      console.log('Activated');
    },
    verified: function(data) {
      console.log('Verified');
    }
  });

```

The first time a user signs up they must pass activation and verification.

Your app should subscribe to all three events and wait until `data.bundle` indicates
that the user has an active status and has been verified.
